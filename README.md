# GitHub Repository

Create a new repository.

## Example Usage

### Create public (e.g. open source) repository

```hcl
module "github_repository" {
  source = "../"

  name = "example"

  description = "My example codebase"

  private = false

  gitignore_template = "Node"
  license_template   = "mit"

  topics = ["example"]
}
```

### Add collaborators and teams

```hcl
module "github_repository" {
  source = "../"

  name = "example"

  description = "My example codebase"

  collaborators = [
    {
      username   = "kbab6aoo"
      permission = "push"
    },
    {
      username   = "kbab6aoo-bot"
      permission = "pull"
    },
  ]

  teams = [
    {
      name       = "terraform"
      permission = "push"
    },
    {
      name       = "security"
      permission = "pull"
    },
  ]
}
```

### Add deploy keys

```hcl
module "github_repository" {
  source = "../"

  name = "example"

  description = "My example codebase"

  deploy_keys = [
    {
      title = "example-key"
      key   = "ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAA..."

      read_only = true
    },
  ]
}
```

### Configure branch protection

```hcl
module "github_repository" {
  source = "../"

  name = "example"

  description = "My example codebase"

  branch_protection = [
    {
      branch = "master"

      required_status_checks = {
        strict   = true
        contexts = ["terraform-fmt"]
      }

      required_pull_request_reviews = {
        dismiss_stale_reviews      = true
        require_code_owner_reviews = true
      }
    },
  ]
}
```
